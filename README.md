Magic-8
=======

To use the ball, it must be held with the window initially facing down. After "asking the ball" a yes-no question, 
the user then turns the ball so that the window faces him, setting in motion the liquid and die inside. 
When the die floats to the top and one of its faces is pressed against the window, 
the raised letters displace the blue liquid to reveal the message as white letters on a blue background. 
Although many users shake the ball before turning it upright, 
the instructions warn against doing so because it can lead to bubbles. 
   I tried to make a virtual version of it . So, the first version of the App that I came up with was quite crude. 
   For android developers- it comprised of a single activity having two text fields and a button. 
   On click of the button it calls a function which generates a number corresponding to which it sends a value or answer to the textfield
   then i went ahead and made it to operate on a shake using accelorometer.
